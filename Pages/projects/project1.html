            <h1>Section 1</h1>
            <p>So... its taken a good bit of work to get here but I've finally started writing about this project. Obviously since this is a long term project, things will continue to change, but I hope that I'll decide to leave this page once this introductory project is done.</p>
            <p>It's easy to see that the first project on the page is to create the webpage, so on this page I will run through all the decisions I've made so far, and the changes I hope to include in the future.</p>
            <p> Everything under the section 1 tab, could be considered as my "first big sprint," and although it took multiple weeks, I count it all as the same "Session."</p>
            
            <h2>1. Planning</h2>
            <p>To start with I did some a little bit of planning just to get some inspiration and not feel completely overwhelmed when I started the project. This involved hacing a look at a few websites, (some portfolios and some general websites) and getting a grasp on colour schemes used and such. What I found was collected in a powerpoint which is at the top of this page.</p>
            <p>Next, I moved onto figuring out a basic colour scheme which you can see currently being used on this page, and also on the slides. I started off by asking my friends to pick 3 colours and coming up with inbetween shades to connect them, and then seeing what worked for me. The finally colour scheme I went with is basic, but I again wanted to have a simple selection to focus more on the coding. This page will remain in this colour scheme, but the rest of the site will continue to update as I progress with my skills.</p>
            <p>After I was happy with my choice of colours, I decided to create a mock up of what the projects page, and this projects page will look like. As I've developed this site, my opinions have slightly changed and small differences will be seen, as well as larger changes down the line, but again, this page will hopefully remain consistent.</p>
            <p>Finally, after admittedly little planning, I moved onto starting developement, as I feel I work better learning while doing (lets see if I end up regretting that).</p>
            
            <h2>2. Starting Developement</h2>
            <p>Okay so I feel like a good place to start would be to make a couple of folders and chuck things in them, you know, for organisation. I'm not going to google the best way to do this, instead I'm going to make what feels reasonable for me and then eventually make a more robust setup later.</p>
            <div class="imageContainer">
                <img src="../../Images/folderLayout.png" alt="" width="80%" margin-top="20px">
            </div>
            <h3 class="imageTitle">Figure 1: Folder Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>So Figure 1 displays a chart of the folder organisation I picked to use. It's quite simple and I feel makes intuitive sense, the main page is directly accesible and other files such as scripts, styles and other pages are all easily accessible through 1 or 2 sub-folders. Admittedly this step and chart design was to procrastinate starting the actual project, but I better start it now.</p>
            <p>After this I moved onto building the starting 4 webpages, which included the Home, Projects, About, and Contact Page. I filled these in with standard HTML elements and linked them to a relevant CSS and JavaScript file. I feel that when I begin to fill out each page individually, I may just move them all onto one page as there isn't too much content to populate each individually. Regardless, I moved onto designing a Navbar and Favicon for the pages.</p>
            <p>Keeping with my theme of having things be simple, I didn't add a lot cool features to the navbar to begin with, I've simply kept it as a functional bar which you can click on to access each page, and the current page your on, and the page your hovering over have some added styling to help navigate the user easily. I have also added a little "logo-esc" design on the left hand side, 1 to fill the space and 2, to somewhat symbolise that this is my website. As with most features I've implemented, I intent to improve on this as its simply just large transparent text over a linear gradient background, which is a trick I learnt a few years ago while first learning CSS.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I had just downloaded illustrator and realised that every website in my tab bar had a little icon whereas mine had a bit of a boring non-design. I desided it might be fun to try come up with something so I tried a few small designs and landed on this one which I thought was quite nice.</p>
