            <h1>Section 1</h1>
            <p>So... its taken a good bit of work to get here but I've finally started writing about this project. Obviously since this is a long term project, things will continue to change, but I hope that I'll decide to leave this page once this introductory project is done.</p>
            <p>It's easy to see that the first project on the page is to create the webpage, so on this page I will run through all the decisions I've made so far, and the changes I hope to include in the future.</p>
            <p> Everything under the section 1 tab, could be considered as my "first big sprint," and although it took multiple weeks, I count it all as the same "Session."</p>
            
            <h2>1. Planning</h2>
            <p>To start with I did some a little bit of planning just to get some inspiration and not feel completely overwhelmed when I started the project. This involved hacing a look at a few websites, (some portfolios and some general websites) and getting a grasp on colour schemes used and such. What I found was collected in a powerpoint which is at the top of this page.</p>
            <p>Next, I moved onto figuring out a basic colour scheme which you can see currently being used on this page, and also on the slides. I started off by asking my fiends to pick 3 colours and coming up with inbetween shades to connect them, and then seeing what worked for me. The finally colour scheme I went with is basic, but I again wanted to have a simple selection to focus more on the coding. This page will remain in this colour scheme, but the rest of the site will continue to update as I progress with my skills.</p>
            <p>After I was happy with my choice of colours, I decided to create a mock up of what the projects page, and this projects page will look like. As I've developed this site, my opinions have slightly changed and small differences will be seen, as well as larger changes down the line, but again, this page will hopefully remain consistent.</p>
            <p>Finally, after admittedly little planning, I moved onto starting developement, as I feel I work better learning while doing (lets see if I end up regretting that).</p>
