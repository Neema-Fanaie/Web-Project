# Personal Portfolio Website Project

## Project Overview
This is a personal portfolio website project which is intended to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in a professional manner. The website will serve as a digital resume and a platform to share my work with potential employers and collaborators. Currently, I am in the planning phase and will be outlining the goals, features, and technologies to be used in this project, so the website is baren. Hopefully, I will be able to update this README as the project progresses.

## Goals
1. Get back into programming for fun, and to improve my skills
2. Build a "library" of sorts that I can reference in the future
3. Independanly develop and deploy a personal website, with appealing design and user experience

## Features to Implement
1. Various pages for individual projects 
2. Responsive design for mobile and desktop
3. Completed home and about me sections

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Ideally move to using Python and Django for backend
- Hopefully use C/C++ for some projects as well

## Timeline
- Start Date: [21/10/2025]
- No current end date, as this project is ongoing and will be updated as I continue to develop it.
